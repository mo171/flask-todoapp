<h1 align="center">To-Do App</h1>

>  🧘‍♂️ Param Para Ke Anusar — The Tradition Continues!
> Whenever you learn a new framework or library, the tradition says — you must build a **To-Do App!** ✅  

I’ve built many To-Do apps before, but this one is special.  
This time, it’s not just frontend experiments or local storage tricks — it’s **fully full-stack!** 🚀  

---

## 🌟 Overview

This project is a **Full-Stack To-Do Application** built using **Flask** — a powerful Python web framework.  
Each user gets their **own personalized To-Do list**, thanks to authentication and database integration.  

The app allows users to:
- Create 📝
- Read 👀
- Update ✏️
- Delete 🗑️  
tasks seamlessly — with real-time updates powered by the backend.

## 🧩 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology Used |
|--------|------------------|
| **Frontend** | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| **Backend** | Flask (Python) |
| **Database** | SQLite |
| **Hosting** | Render (Live Deployment) |
| **Authentication** | Flask-Login |

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ User Authentication — each user has their own To-Do list  
✅ CRUD Operations — add, edit, delete tasks in real-time  
✅ Responsive Design — works beautifully across devices  
✅ Hosted Online — no setup needed to test it out  
✅ Clean, minimal UI for productivity
